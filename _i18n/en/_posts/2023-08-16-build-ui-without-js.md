# Who's listening

Sofware engineers and potential clients with interest about building data products

## Step 1

### By the end of the conversation they will... decide to/agree to

It's possible to build customizable and beautiful dashboards, interfaces and applications without JS knowledge.

### In order to achieve this they need to...

#### Know

1. Data scientists and machine learning engineers already has multiple knowledge in python, math and data, and learn javascript can be challenge when your job already require deep knowledge in multiple areas.
2. There is a trend of building tooling for data scientists and machine learning engineers so that they abstract additional complexity (like javascript)
3. The tools tries to use knowledge that data scientists and machine learning engineers already know (like Python, pandas, matplotlib)
4. Tools like ipywidgets, ipyvuetify, reacton, solara, allow building custom dashboards using python only. Enabling users to build custom layouts with html inputs and minimal python code

#### Feel

1. Curious to try one of the tooling listed in the post
2. Relieved of don't have to learn a new technology to work on data science/machine learning projects

## Step 2

### Relevance: Why should they care?

1. Because it can help their career, presenting tools that can speed up feature deliveries
2. It's hard to keep up date with the state of art of data science tooling and this article can help

## Step 3

### What's your message in one sentence?

You don't need JS knowledge to build beautiful and customizable components

# Building Beautiful Data Products Without Knowing JavaScript

In today's rapidly evolving data landscape, the demand for visually compelling data products has skyrocketed. The question that arises often is: Do you need to master JavaScript to craft such products? The answer is a resounding "No". There's a trove of tools available that allow you to bypass the intricacies of JS, leveraging the knowledge you already have.

## The Knowledge Paradigm

1. Mastering Multiple Domains: As a data scientist or a machine learning engineer, you're already well-versed in Python, well-acquainted with the intricacies of data, and possess substantial expertise in mathematics. To top that up with the understanding of JavaScript can feel overwhelming.
2. Simplifying Complexity: Recognizing the challenges, there's a growing trend of developing tools tailor-made for data professionals. The intent is clear: Abstain from adding more complexity, instead harness what they already know.
3. Lean on What You Know: These tools have been meticulously crafted keeping in mind the familiar territories of data professionals - Python, pandas, matplotlib, etc.
4. Emerging Tools of the Trade: Enter the world of ipywidgets, ipyvuetify, reacton, and solara. These tools are not just Python-centric, but they empower you to craft custom dashboards. With just a hint of Python code and the ability to design with basic HTML inputs, you can curate personalized layouts and interactive components.

## The Feeling Factor

Feeling overwhelmed by the thought of diving into another programming language? Don't be.

1. Spark Curiosity: The tools mentioned are intuitive, ensuring a smooth learning curve. It might just pique your interest to give them a whirl.
2. Breathe Easy: Remember, it’s not about juggling multiple technologies. It's about making the most of what you know and delivering optimal results.

## Why Should This Matter to You?

1. Accelerate Your Career: Integrating these tools into your workflow can not only enhance your productivity but also position you as a resourceful professional who can hasten feature deliveries.
2. Stay Updated, Effortlessly: The world of data science tooling is vast and ever-evolving. With a plethora of tools surfacing every day, it's an uphill task to keep tabs on them. This article offers you a glimpse of the latest, ensuring you’re not left behind.

## In Conclusion

You don't need JS knowledge to build beautiful and customizable components. The tools at your disposal today are both powerful and user-friendly, emphasizing on maximizing your existing knowledge. Dive in, explore, and let your data products shine brighter than ever!
