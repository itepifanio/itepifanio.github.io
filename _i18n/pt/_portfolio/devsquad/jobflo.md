Jobflo was the first project that I could act as a technical lead, coordinating, reviewing, developing, and helping junior developers. Since I was working as a consultant I was responsible for technically coordinating Devsquad's team and also Jobflo's team.

When I started to work on the project most of the core features were already developed, but the fast development of the project in the past led to a lot of bugs. As soon as I entered the project my focus was to refactor, increase the test suite and improve the documentation that didn't exist. 

In a six-month span, we were able to increase the project test suite from 100 tests to more than 450, this made the hotfixes of the software decrease drastically. Since I was coordinating junior developers as soon they ask me a question I answered by writing a new doc page, which led to a big a very good project wiki for beginners. It was noticeable how faster new developers were able to work on the project just by reading the docs and guidelines. 

Further than creating the project's documentation, increase drastically the test suite, and improving code quality, I was responsible to introduce two big features in the software:

- The geofencing feature allowed sellers to be assigned to a geographical area drawn in a map, this also lead to reports for managers. Geofencing was my first experience working with GIS and I had a great time developing this module. 

- Jobflo's no-code workflow. The managers want to mount their own workflow based on Jobflo's events to work fast and automate some internal processes. Similar to Jira's workflow, I was able to develop a very custom workflow experience that allowed managers to mount their workflows with a logical solutions.
