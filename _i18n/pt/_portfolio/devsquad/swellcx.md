Helped to develop a new version of the software using Laravel Livewire package. The SwellCX's version 3 had a fast pace development in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, where a lot of new customers start to use the project. 
New modules were developed, for example, the payment suite, one of the most expected features from v3. Also, a lot of optimization was made, since new clients start to use the software in the middle of the v3 migration we worked hard to make their experience even better.
