[Drivably](https://drivably.com/sellonthespot/) offers car owners the convenience 
of obtaining an instant price for their vehicle based on market value, facilitating 
selling schedules and financial transactions.

This project marked my debut at DevSquad. My responsibilities included developing and 
maintaining the Drivably website. This involved managing financial subscription modules, 
enhancing the user interface, and resolving any eventual bug. The technologies utilized 
in this project were Vue.js for the frontend and Laravel (PHP) for the backend.

During this time, numerous API integrations were implemented. These efforts enabled advanced 
timezone management and expanded the market reach beyond the United States.
