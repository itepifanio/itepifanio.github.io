[Drivably](https://drivably.com/sellonthespot/) helps car owners to get an instant price of their 
vehicle based on the market value. It allows selling schedule and finantial transactions.

It was my first project at DevSquad. I was responsible for developing and maintain Drivably's website:
Maintain the financial subscriptions modules, improving the UI, and fixing eventual bugs.
The technologies used in this project were Vuejs to the frontend and Laravel (PHP) for the backend.

A lot of API integrations were made during this period. Advanced timezone and conquer markets beyond 
United Stated were achieved.
