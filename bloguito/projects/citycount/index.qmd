The Citycount project showcased an AI-based traffic counting system, emphasizing privacy-awareness 
and real-time evaluation directly on an edge device.

This was my inaugural project focusing on data governance and data versioning to enhance reproducibility. 
An internal [Intake plugin](https://github.com/intake/intake) was developed specifically to manage the 
[webdataset format](https://github.com/webdataset/webdataset) and other ML-related data types.

A critical aspect of the project was the ability to switch between multiple models seamlessly, 
necessitating the use of effective deployment tools. During this phase, I was responsible for 
refactoring open-source code to facilitate easy model switching. I also conducted experiments 
using [Triton](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/user-guide/docs/user_guide/architecture.html) 
for model deployment and versioning.

The project used [Ipyannotator](https://github.com/palaimon/ipyannotator), a framework for data annotation, to apply 
post-processing techniques and enhance infered data. It leveraged the Python ecosystem extensively, 
including PyTorch, Python Packaging, Nbdev, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Image, Pillow, OpenCV, Scipy, and more.
