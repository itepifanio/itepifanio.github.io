Citycount project demonstrated AI-based traffic counting usage in a 
privacy-aware manner through real-time evaluation directly on a edge 
device.

It was my first project considering data governance and data versioning 
to improve reproducibility. An internal [Intake plugin](https://github.com/intake/intake) 
was developed to handle [webdataset format](https://github.com/webdataset/webdataset) and 
other ML-related data typing.

Switching between multiple models was essential, and using a good tool 
for deployment as well. During this time I was responsible to refactor 
open source code to easily switch the code, and run experiments using 
[Triton](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/user-guide/docs/user_guide/architecture.html) 
to deploy models and versionate them.

It was a fun project that combined post-processing techniques using 
[Ipyannotator](https://github.com/palaimon/ipyannotator), a framework for 
data annotation. Python and its ecossytem: PyTorch, Python Packaging, Nbdev, 
Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Image, Pillow, OpenCV, Scipy, etc
