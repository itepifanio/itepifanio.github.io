[Jobflo](https://www.jobflo.co/) is a software solution tailored for the solar industry, 
designed to automate workflow and empower sales teams. I joined the project one year after 
its inception and was tasked with establishing a Git flow, enhancing quality assurance, 
and promoting a test culture. These initiatives led to an 80% reduction in hotfixes.

The implementation of small releases and code review practices significantly accelerated 
the speed of code deployment. During my tenure, substantial features were introduced, 
including a no-code workflow that enables admins to customize user actions in the system, 
and a geo-spatial feature to efficiently track the sales team's proximity to leads. 
These developments substantially enhanced the product's value.
