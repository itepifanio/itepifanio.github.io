[Jobflo](https://www.jobflo.co/) it's a software tailored for the solar industry, 
allowing companies to automatize their workflow and empower the sales team.
I entered the project after one year of it's development and I was responsible 
for stablish a git flow, quality assurance and test culture that decreased hotfixes in 80%.

The small releases and code review practices increased the code shipping speed.
During this time big features like a no-code workflow for admins to customize user's 
actions in the system, and a geo-spatial feature to track sales team closer to leads 
were launched, bringing a lot of value to the product.
