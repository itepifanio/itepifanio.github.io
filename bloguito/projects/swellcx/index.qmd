[SwellCX](https://www.swellcx.com/) is designed to gather both private and public 
feedback from clients and employees, enabling businesses to enhance their online 
reputation and improve the overall client and employee experience.

During my time with SwellCX, I played a key role in developing a new version of 
the software, utilizing the Laravel Livewire package. The development of SwellCX 
version 3 occurred between the COVID-19 pandemic, a period which saw a 
significant influx of new customers, resulting in triple-digit growth.

One of the major developments in this version was the introduction of a new payment suite, 
a highly anticipated feature. Extensive optimizations were implemented to ensure a 
seamless experience for new users. Our efforts contributed significantly to SwellCX's 
success, as evidenced by its 
[8 million dollar fundraising round](https://www.swellcx.com/resources/swell-raises-8m-series-a-after-experiencing-triple-digit-growth-in-2020).
