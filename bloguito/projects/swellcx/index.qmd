[SwellCX](https://www.swellcx.com/) gather private and public feedback from clients and employees.
It allows business to boost their online reputation and improve the client/employee experience.

I helped to develop a new version of the software using Laravel Livewire package. 
The SwellCX's version 3 had a fast pace development in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
where a lot of new customers start to use the project (we had triple digits grow).

New modules were developed, for example, the payment suite, one of the most expected features from v3. 
A lot of optimization had to be made to make new users experience even better. Our work 
led to SwellCX [raise 8 million dolars](https://www.swellcx.com/resources/swell-raises-8m-series-a-after-experiencing-triple-digit-growth-in-2020).
