Developed from scratch the MVP of Boosterhub using PHP, Laravel, and the Livewire package. 

In a period of three months, we deliver a multi-tenant software with a customizable page builder 
and a custom e-commerce solution. It was very fun to integrate the e-commerce with the USIO payment 
suite since their team helped us a lot.

I also was responsible to develop a full calendar solution. It was very challenging to develop the recurring 
event system of the calendar in a short period of time, but the final solution was a well-tested code that 
considered timezones, event reminders, and commercial time to send the email/SMS reminders.

Boosterhub's webchat was also developed by me. A real-time chat using Twilio WebSocket that allowed users of 
the same team to communicate with each other and also create groups of users to easily communicate with the 
whole team.
