Developed from scratch, the MVP of Boosterhub was created using PHP, Laravel, and the Livewire package.

Over a three-month period, we delivered a multi-tenant software featuring a customizable page builder and 
an e-commerce solution. Integrating e-commerce with the USIO payment suite was particularly enjoyable, 
largely due to the extensive support from their team.

I was also tasked with developing a comprehensive calendar solution. Developing the recurring event system 
within a tight timeframe posed a significant challenge. However, the final product was a well-tested code 
that accounted for timezones, event reminders, and optimal timing for sending email/SMS reminders.

Additionally, I developed Boosterhub's webchat. This real-time chat, powered by Twilio WebSocket, 
enabled team members to communicate effectively, facilitating both one-on-one and group discussions 
within the team.
