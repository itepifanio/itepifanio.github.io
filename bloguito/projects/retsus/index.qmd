[Retsus](https://retsus.ufrn.br/login) it's a national academic management system used 
in most states of Brazil. It was developed using PHP, Laravel and JQuery, with the 
advent of VueJS the tool was slowly integrated in the workflow.

As a big software used for multiple schools in the country its requirements were 
complex and it was needed to train multiple people to use the tool. It was my first 
experience traveling to meet the final user and train them. The understanding of the 
user and school context, led to a lot of improvements in usability, accessibility 
and prepared me to be a user-focused developer.
