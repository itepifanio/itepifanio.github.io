[Retsus](https://retsus.ufrn.br/login) is a national academic management system extensively 
used across various states in Brazil. Initially developed using PHP, Laravel, and JQuery, 
the system gradually integrated VueJS into its workflow.

Given its widespread use in numerous schools nationwide, the software's requirements were complex, 
necessitating extensive training for multiple users. This project marked my first experience in 
traveling to meet end-users and providing them with training. Directly understanding the users 
and their school contexts led to significant enhancements in usability and accessibility. 
This experience was pivotal in shaping my approach as a user-focused developer.
