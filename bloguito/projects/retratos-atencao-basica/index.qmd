[Retratos da atenção básica](https://retratos.navi.ifrn.edu.br) is a web data application 
that enables researchers and the general public to access and cross-reference information 
about the Brazilian primary care system. The app was developed using PostgreSQL for 
database management, VueJS and Laravel for the frontend and backend respectively. 
Additional data analysis was conducted using Python and Pandas.

This project presented a significant challenge due to the vast amount of data and the requirement 
for complex query execution. To enhance performance and facilitate data aggregation, advanced 
PostgreSQL features, such as materialized views, were extensively utilized.
