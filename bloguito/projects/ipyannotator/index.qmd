Ipyannotator is an open-source annotation framework that operates on top of
Jupyter notebooks. It harnesses the capabilities of [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/) 
to bring data scientists closer to data annotation, while also providing a conducive environment 
for professional annotators to explore, create, and improve annotations.

During my time at Palaimon GmbH, I spearheaded the refactoring of the state management 
in Ipyannotator, adopting a pub-sub architecture to streamline and decouple the codebase. 
A significant contribution was the development of a video annotator, which later found 
applications in both internal and external projects. Notably, Ipyannotator was also published 
in the [JOSS (Journal of Open Source Software)](https://joss.theoj.org/).

The project extensively utilized tools from the Jupyter notebooks ecosystem, including numpy, 
scikit-image, pandas, pillow, nbdev, and python packaging.
