Ipyannotator is an open source annotation framework that runs on top of Jupyter notebooks. 
It uses [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/) powers to bring data scientist 
closer to the data annotation, and also providing an environment where professional annotators 
can explore, create and improve annotations.

This was my first project at Palaimon GmbH, I was responsible to refactor the state management 
of the project, using a pub-sub architecture to decouple the code. A video annotator was also 
developed during my time in the project, which was later use for internal and external projects.
Ipyannotator was also published at [JOSS (Journal of Open Source Software)](https://joss.theoj.org/)

pillow, nbdev, python packaging, were used.
